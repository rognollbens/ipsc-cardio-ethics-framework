# Contributing to the iPSC Cardio Ethics Framework

We welcome contributions from researchers, ethicists, clinicians, patient advocates, and anyone interested in shaping the ethical guidelines for autologous iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte therapies.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Discuss First
- Before making significant changes, please open or join a discussion in the relevant GitHub Issue.
- Issues are organized around the four core ethical pillars of this framework.

### 2. Respectful Dialogue
- All discussions must be evidence-based, respectful, and focused on the scientific and ethical questions at hand.
- Personal attacks, discriminatory language, or off‑topic comments will not be tolerated.

### 3. Making Changes
- To propose edits to the framework document (`ETHICAL_FRAMEWORK.md`), fork the repository and create a new branch.
- Submit a Pull Request (PR) that clearly references the Issue(s) your changes address.
- PRs should include a concise description of the proposed changes and the rationale behind them.

### 4. Review Process
- Every PR will be reviewed by at least one project maintainer.
- Inline comments on the PR are for specific wording or technical suggestions.
- Broader ethical debates should continue in the associated Issue threads.

### 5. Consensus‑Driven Development
- The goal is to arrive at a consensus‑based document. When disagreements arise, we encourage data‑driven arguments and, where needed, compromise.
- The final decision on merging rests with the project maintainers, guided by the quality of the discussion.

Thank you for helping to build a robust, transparent, and inclusive ethical framework!
